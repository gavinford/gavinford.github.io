  	<h1>Favorite Book</h1>
    <h2>Choice: Hunger Games</h2>
    <div style="border: 10px solid #FABD2F; padding: 10px;">
    <p>My Favorite book is The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. It is about a girl named Katniss who has to fight to the death in an arena against other teenagers. It takes place on Earth likely about 100 years in the future in a place called Panem. The main character is a girl named Katniss Everdeen who is 16 years old. She gets selected by the Capital from their district along with a boy named Peeta Mellark. They must go to an arena and compete in the hunger games where they must fight to the death against 22 other teenagers. Against all odds, Katniss and Peeta actually are the last two survivors in the arena. But there can only be one winner and they would not kill each other so they were about to eat poisonous berries but the announcer said they both won. The first main character is Katniss Everdeen. She is 16 years old and lives in District 12. Katniss has medium-length brown hair and greyish-blue eyes. She lives with her little sister and her mom. They are very poor. The other main character is Peeta Mellark. He is 16 years old and lives in District 12 just like Katniss. He helps his family by baking in the family bakery. He has short, blond hair and brown eyes.</p>

    <p>I chose The Hunger Games as my favorite book becuase it is very exciting throughout the entire book and has a very interesting plot. I also like how it takes place in the future because it makes you wonder what the future might really be like. There is also two other books in the series. Number two, <i>Catching Fire,</i> and <i>Mockingjay.</i> I look forward to reading those next.
