    <h1>Future Career</h1>
    <h2>Computer Programmer</h2>
    <p>In the future the career I want is to be a computer programmer. Computer programmers work in many different types of campanies but all use computers to create software to help their company. Computer programmers need to be good at coding in various languages, depending on what they will be coding. A computer programmers annual average salary is $81,000. To get this job I will need to work hard and pursue more advanced mathematic classes and also continue to take computer related classes (I am currently in Exploring COmputer Science.)</p>
